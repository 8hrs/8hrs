## Summary
**8hrs** is web application designed and developed by Team [Haymarket](https://github.com/8hrs) to help workers communicate and organize.

## Application Concept
Our app will allow individuals at an organization communicate and to start to organize the beginning stages of a labor organization. Participation made digitally will reduce the concerns of individuals feeling they would be who would be spied on, harassed, pressured, threatened, suspended, fired, deported or otherwise victimized if they publically attempted to even show interest in joining a union.
The app can be accessed here: https://8hrs.github.io/8hrs/.

## Motivation for Development
Americans want more influence in the workplace to win better wages, better benefits, and more flexible work schedules—all of which can be gained through joining a union. The ability of employees to join a labor union is the single largest unclaimed legal right to additional personal wealth in America today.

## Design Process
We wanted to create a simple yet appealing interface that would allow individuals to quickly see information based on current campaigns and to create one if one did not exist.
